# Bike Sharing Assignment
### by Ritesh Kumar

## Objective
The *objective* of the assignment is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various independent factors. This model will help BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US, to understand the key variables affecting bike demand and adjust their business strategy accordingly. The ultimate goal is to enhance the company's revenue by effectively meeting customer demand post-lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This involves:
- Identifying significant predictors of bike demand.
- Quantifying the influence of these predictors.
- Using the model to guide decision-making for better resource allocation, pricing strategies, and operationalÂ planning.

## General Information
<b>Bike-Sharing System:</b> A service where bicycles are made available for shared use by individuals for short-term rentals, often managed through docking stations.<br>
<b>BoomBikes:</b> A US-based bike-sharing provider facing revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
<b>Business Problem:</b> BoomBikes needs to understand the factors influencing bike demand post-lockdown to adjust their business strategy and regain profitability.<br>
### Data:
The dataset consists of various features, including meteorological factors, dates, seasons, and user demographics, which affect the demand for shared bikes.
### Model Objective:
The objective is to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict daily bike demand using these independent variables. The model will help the management identify the significant factors influencing demand, thereby enabling better decision-making.

## Conclusions
The model reveals that temperature, humidity, and windspeed are significant predictors of bike demand, with temperature having a strong positive effect and humidity and windspeed having negative effects. Seasonal and weather conditions, as well as specific days and months, also significantly impact bike demand.

##### Based on the analysis of the regression model, the company should focus on the following features to optimize bike-sharing operations:
- Temperature (temp):
Focus: Implement strategies to maximize bike availability and marketing efforts during warmer temperatures, as higher temperatures significantly boost bike demand.

- Humidity (hum):
Focus: Monitor humidity levels and adjust bike-sharing operations accordingly. Since higher humidity negatively impacts demand, the company might consider promoting bike-sharing options or providing amenities to mitigate the effects of high humidity.

- Windspeed (windspeed):
Focus: Be aware of the impact of windspeed on bike demand. During high wind conditions, demand decreases, so the company could consider special promotions or operational adjustments on windy days.

- Seasonal Variations (summer, winter):
Focus: Adjust bike availability and marketing strategies based on the season. The model indicates higher demand during summer and winter, so the company should ensure adequate bike supply and tailored marketing during these seasons.

- Weather Conditions (mist, snow or rain):
Focus: Prepare for lower bike demand during misty or snowy/rainy weather by optimizing bike distribution and implementing targeted promotions to encourage usage despite adverse conditions.

- Day of the Week (Tuesday):
Focus: Since bike demand is lower on Tuesdays, the company might consider running specific promotions or adjusting bike distribution on this day to boost usage.

- Month (September):
Focus: September shows higher demand, so the company should ensure sufficient bike availability and potentially increase marketing efforts during this month.

##### By focusing on these features, BoomBikes can better align their operations with factors that influence bike demand, improving service efficiency and potentially increasing revenue.
